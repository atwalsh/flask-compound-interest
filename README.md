# flask-compound-interest

A flask introduction app that calculates compound interest.


*Before you start:*
1. Get Python 3.7.0 installed ([pyenv][3] makes it easy)
2. Get PyCharm installed
3. Install `flask` (look up how to use `Pipenv`)

FYI -- HTML templates are using [Bootstrap][2] to make elements look nice.

*Objectives*

1. Build a compound interest calculator. Figure out how to:

    1. Read input from `form.html` into flask route.
    1. Write a function to calculate compound interest.
    1. Display the result on the form page.

I have created the form page, follow the web address printed to the terminal when you run the app.

Run the Flask app:
```python
python app.py
```
